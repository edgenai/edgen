- [x] **Optimized Inference**: You don't need to take a PhD in AI optimization. ⚡Edgen abstracts the complexity of optimizing inference for different hardware, platforms and models.
- [x] **Modular**: ⚡Edgen is **model** and **runtime** agnostic. New models can be added easily and ⚡Edgen can select the best runtime for the user's hardware: you don't need to keep up about the latest models and ML runtimes - **⚡Edgen will do that for you**.
- [x] **Model Caching**: ⚡Edgen caches foundational models locally, so 1 model can power hundreds of different apps - users don't need to download the same model multiple times.
- [x] **Native**: ⚡Edgen is build in 🦀Rust and is natively compiled to all popular platforms. No docker required.
- [x] **OpenAI Compliant API**: ⚡Edgen is a drop-in replacement for OpenAI.

⚡Edgen lets you use GenAI in your app, completely **locally** on your user's devices, for **free** and with **data-privacy**. It's a drop-in replacement for OpenAI (it uses the a compatible API), supports various functions like text generation, speech-to-text and works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

### Features

- [x] Session Caching: ⚡Edgen maintains top performance with big contexts (big chat histories), by caching sessions. Sessions are auto-detected in function of the chat history.

### Endpoints

- [x] \[Chat\] [Completions](https://docs.edgen.co/api-reference/chat)
- [x] \[Audio\] [Transcriptions](https://docs.edgen.co/api-reference/audio)
- [ ] \[Image\] Generation
- [ ] \[Chat\] Multimodal chat completions
- [ ] \[Audio\] Speech

### Supported platforms

- [x] Windows
- [x] Linux
- [x] MacOS

## 🔥 Hot Topics

## Why local GenAI?

- **Data Private**: On-device inference means **users' data** never leave their devices.

- **Scalable**: More and more users? No need to increment cloud computing infrastructure. Just let your users use their own hardware.

- **Reliable**: No internet, no downtime, no rate limits, no API keys.

- **Free**: It runs locally on hardware the user already owns.

## Quickstart

1. [Download](https://edgen.co/download) and start ⚡Edgen
2. Chat with ⚡[EdgenChat](https://chat.edgen.co)

⚡Edgen usage:

```
Usage: edgen [<command>] [<args>]

Toplevel CLI commands and options. Subcommands are optional. If no command is provided "serve" will be invoked with default options.

Options:
  --help            display usage information

Commands:
  serve             Starts the edgen server. This is the default command when no
                    command is provided.
  config            Configuration-related subcommands.
  version           Prints the edgen version to stdout.
  oasgen            Generates the Edgen OpenAPI specification.
```

# Developers

The following sections are for people looking to contribute to ⚡Edgen.

## Architecture Overview

## Quickstart

Edgen uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) for dependency management and development environments.
To get up-and-running quickly, [install Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html),
[enable Nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes), and run:

```bash
nix develop
# TODO: Insert run command here
```

Then open your favorite IDE from the shell, and you're ready to go!
