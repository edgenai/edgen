# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Protocol API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Protocol API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API](#).

## Choose your client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. ⚡Edgen offers clients for Python and Node.js. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

{/* TODO: Edit with our published packages */}

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
# cURL is most likely already installed on your machine. If not, install it
curl --version
```

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
# Install the Node API client
npm install edgen --save
```

```bash {{ language: 'python' }}
# Install the Python API client
pip install edgen
```

</CodeGroup>

## Making your first API request

You are ready to make your first call to the ⚡Edgen API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the chat completions endpoint to create a chat response, given an list of input chat messages.

{/* TODO: Edit with our published packages */}
{/* TODO: Do not hardcode this codegroup. Since it's already defined in /api-reference/chat */}

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/conversations">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -d limit=10
```

```js
import ApiClient from '@example/protocol-api'

const client = new ApiClient(token)

await client.conversations.list()
```

```python
from protocol_api import ApiClient

client = ApiClient(token)

client.conversations.list()
```

```php
$client = new \Protocol\ApiClient($token);

$client->conversations->list();
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
